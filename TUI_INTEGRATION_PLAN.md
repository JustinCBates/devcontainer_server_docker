# TUI Integration Plan for Multi-Repository Projects

**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Purpose:** Document planned TUI integrations for WSL Manager and VPS Environment  
**Status:** Planning Phase

---

## üéØ **Overview**

This document outlines the planned integration of TUI Form Designer into the WSL & Docker Manager and VPS Testing Environment projects to create modern, user-friendly terminal interfaces.

## üîß **WSL & Docker Manager TUI Integration**

### **Current State**
- PowerShell-based scripts with basic console output
- Manual parameter configuration
- Limited user guidance and error handling
- No interactive configuration wizards

### **Planned TUI Components**

#### **1. üéõÔ∏è Master Configuration Wizard**
```yaml
layout_id: "wsl_docker_setup_wizard"
title: "WSL & Docker Desktop Setup Wizard"
description: "Interactive configuration for Docker Desktop and WSL 2 optimization"

steps:
  - System requirements check
  - Backup location selection
  - Installation preferences
  - Performance optimization options
```

#### **2. üì¶ Component Selection Interface**
```yaml
layout_id: "wsl_component_selector"
title: "Installation Component Selector"
description: "Choose which components to install, uninstall, or configure"

steps:
  - Phase selection (backup, uninstall, install, restore)
  - Docker configuration options
  - WSL distribution management
  - Advanced settings
```

#### **3. ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Configuration**
```yaml
layout_id: "wsl_advanced_config"
title: "Advanced WSL & Docker Configuration"
description: "Fine-tune performance and storage settings"

steps:
  - Dynamic disk allocation settings
  - Memory allocation preferences
  - Storage location selection
  - Docker backend options
```

## üê≥ **VPS Testing Environment TUI Integration**

### **Current State**
- Python script with basic interactive prompts
- Hard-coded distribution configurations
- Limited environment management
- Basic Docker container orchestration

### **Planned TUI Components**

#### **1. üêß Distribution Family Selector**
```yaml
layout_id: "vps_distro_selector"
title: "Linux Distribution Family Selector"
description: "Choose from organized distribution families for testing"

steps:
  - Family overview (Debian, Red Hat, Alpine, SUSE, Arch)
  - Distribution comparison
  - System requirement validation
  - Container resource allocation
```

#### **2. üöÄ Launch Configuration Wizard**
```yaml
layout_id: "vps_launch_config"
title: "VPS Environment Launch Configuration"
description: "Configure your testing environment deployment"

steps:
  - Container deployment mode (fresh, persistent, snapshot)
  - Port mapping configuration
  - Volume mount setup
  - SSH key configuration
  - Testing scenario selection
```

#### **3. üìä Environment Management Dashboard**
```yaml
layout_id: "vps_environment_dashboard"
title: "VPS Environment Management"
description: "Monitor and manage running VPS testing environments"

steps:
  - Running container status
  - Resource usage monitoring
  - Backup/restore operations
  - State management (save, load, reset)
```

#### **4. üîß Advanced Deployment Wizard**
```yaml
layout_id: "vps_deployment_wizard"
title: "Application Deployment Configuration"
description: "Set up complex deployment scenarios for testing"

steps:
  - Application deployment configuration
  - Multi-container orchestration
  - Testing automation setup
  - Performance monitoring configuration
```

## üîÑ **Implementation Priority**

### **Phase 1: WSL Manager MVP**
1. Master Configuration Wizard (core setup flow)
2. Component Selection Interface (essential functionality)
3. Basic error handling and validation

### **Phase 2: VPS Environment MVP**
1. Distribution Family Selector (core distribution selection)
2. Launch Configuration Wizard (essential deployment)
3. Basic environment monitoring

### **Phase 3: Advanced Features**
1. Advanced configuration options
2. Environment management dashboard
3. Complex deployment scenarios
4. Performance monitoring and optimization

## üõ†Ô∏è **Development Strategy**

### **TUI Package Distribution**
1. Fix TUI Form Designer issues (completed)
2. Create TUI packages for distribution
3. Integrate TUI into WSL Manager project
4. Integrate TUI into VPS Environment project
5. Test and iterate based on user feedback

### **Multi-Repository Workflow**
1. TUI Form Designer (source repository)
   - Develop and fix TUI components
   - Build and package TUI releases
   - Push updates to main repository

2. WSL Manager & VPS Environment (consumer repositories)
   - Pull TUI package updates
   - Implement project-specific TUI layouts
   - Test integration and report issues back to TUI team

### **Build & Distribution Pipeline**
1. TUI Form Designer build system creates packages
2. Packages are distributed to consumer projects
3. Consumer projects install and integrate TUI
4. Issues are reported back for TUI improvements
5. Cycle repeats for continuous improvement

## üìã **Success Criteria**

### **WSL Manager MVP Success**
- Users can complete full Docker/WSL setup through TUI
- Configuration is clearly guided and validated
- Error handling provides actionable feedback
- Process is faster and more reliable than manual approach

### **VPS Environment MVP Success**
- Users can select and launch distributions through TUI
- Container configuration is intuitive and validated
- Environment status is clearly visible
- Common deployment scenarios are automated
